    <h3>Hello and Welcome to my Web Portfolio</h3>
    <hr>
    <section class="introduction">
    <p>
        Hello, My name is Roggero Spezialy and this is a web portfolio to show case my coding abilities as well as to create something more visiually appealing and dynamic then a simplistic two dimesional resume
    </p>
    <p>
        In this WebPholio I wanted to highlight some of the skills I have aquired through Springboard, and through self research.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little about me, I like to play video games usually RPG or advenutre, I enjoy the dynamics of the Indie/Retro styles as well as some of the newer styles. I love sandbox style games as well becuase it allows users/players to create new and fasinating things.
